{"title":"how to use chatgpt efficienty","content":"When AI-powered chatbots and image generators first came on the scene, I was admittedly a little skeptical. It was mostly because the news headlines—at least, the ones my algorithm was feeding me—were fear-inducing (see: People fear being replaced by AI and ChatGPT). But it was also because I didn't know how any of it worked. In a pleasant turn of events, I discovered no fewer than 28,349 ways ChatGPT alone can help me be better at my job. For example, it can help me brainstorm new ideas and create rough outlines for blog posts. It can even act as my own personal writing coach.  Go to chat.openai.com or the mobile app, and log in or sign up (it's free). \n\nType your prompt in the message box on the ChatGPT home page. \n\nOnce ChatGPT spits out a response, you have a handful of options: \n\nEdit your original prompt.\n\nEnter a new prompt. \n\nRegenerate the response.\n\nCopy the response. \n\nShare the response.\n\nDislike the response.
